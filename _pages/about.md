Oh, hello. I'm Ben -- a Data Engineering Manager at [Factual](https://www.factual.com) ([we're hiring](http://factual.com/jobs)). Professionally, I like to wrangle data and lead teams. Personally, I like to explore LA with my family and go to hip restaurants at unreasonably early hours to avoid lines.

I use this site to keep my contact information current and post articles that I write (indie data journalism, of sorts).
